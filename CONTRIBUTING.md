## What should I know before I get started?

CODE-RADE relies heavily on web services and is pretty tightly integrated with Github, because CODE-RADE :heart: :octocat:. Having a github account will help us collaborate far easier. We use Jenkins to run tests, so we _can_ test from repos in any VCS that Jenkins supports, which is basically all of them, but we _do_ use Github OAuth for authentication. There are plans to allow SAML-based identity federation authentication, but what we've got is working out pretty well so far... so...

### Documentation <!-- TODO -->

CODE-RADE consists of several submodules which are the individual applciations which we test.

Each module's README file should :

  1. Include a build status badge
  1. Explain what the application is
  1. Describe the direct dependencies (one level down)
  2. Describe the supported versions
  3. Describe where the example scripts for running the application are

Additionally, each submodule should have a subdirectory containing examples of how to use it on various platforms.
