The solution – as well as the dead ends – are part of the process.
If it's not in a version-controlled repository, it's no good.
If it's not executable (in a wiki/document, etc), then you have to convert it back into something a computer understands – why not just leave it in executable format ?
Recognise that solutions decay and code for the future.
Assign versioned persistent identifiers to all artefacts.
